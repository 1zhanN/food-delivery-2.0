# Tomato Food Delivery 2.0

The Tomato Food Delivery App (Functional Version) is an updated implementation of the original project, focusing more on the functionality aspects using React concepts.

## Functionality Overview

- **Cart Management**: Users can view their current cart items, adjust quantities, and remove items.

## Learnings

In the process of building Tomato Food Delivery 2.0, several key learnings were gained:

- **Prop Drilling**: Understanding how to efficiently pass data from parent components to deeply nested child components without explicitly passing props through intermediary components.
- **Looping in JSX**: Learning how to iterate over arrays or objects directly within JSX to dynamically render elements based on the data.
